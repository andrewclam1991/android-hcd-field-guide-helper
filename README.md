HCD (Human Center Design) Field Guide Helper App - an open-source Android App that is 100.00% inspired by of IDEO's The Field Guide to Human-Centered Design http://www.designkit.org/resources/1.

## Project Mission
This project shares the same mission and vision as IDEO, that is "is to spread human-centered design to social sector practitioners around the world." We also hope this helper app can get you solving problems like a designer.

## Motivation behind the app
Back in college 16', Andrew was introduced to and immediately fell in love with the IDEO's The Field Guide to Human-Centered Design. Since then, Andrew've used the field guide in many personal projects. However, implementing the steps faithfully generates a lot of real juicy materials -- materials that can get really unorganized real fast. He just wish if there is a way to keep all the ideas, surveys and voice recording materials organized by project, all in a device that moves with you.

## 
This app is intented to helpe practitioners managing project data, No-doubt this app won't replace, nor should it, replace pencils-and-paper requirements, this project wants to make their methodologies more even accessible and convienent to practitioners, including myself.

## Disclaimer
This app is NOT endorsed by IDEO in anyway, anyshape or anyform.
