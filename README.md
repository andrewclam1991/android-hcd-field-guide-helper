HCD (Human Center Design) Field Guide Helper App - an open-source Android App that is 100.00% inspired by of IDEO's The Field Guide to Human-Centered Design http://www.designkit.org/resources/1.

## Project Mission
This project shares the same mission and vision as IDEO, that is "to spread human-centered design to social sector practitioners around the world." Along with the IDEO's The Field Guide, we hope this helper app can get you solving problems like a designer, faster.

## Motivation behind the Project
Back in 16' Andrew was introduced to and immediately fell in love with the IDEO's The Field Guide to Human-Centered Design. Since then, He've used the field guide in many personal projects. However, he found step implementations actually generate lots of real juicy materials - materials that can get really unorganized real fast. He needed a way to keep all the ideas, surveys and voice recording materials organized by project, all in a device that moves with him. He couldn't find one in the app store as of 2018, So, out comes this attempt of a solution.

## Intention
This project is intented to help practitioners managing project data, No-doubt this app won't replace, nor should it, replace pencils-and-paper requirements. this project wants to make their methodologies more even accessible and convienent to practitioners, including myself. This project will always be open-source, always non-commerical, always free*.
